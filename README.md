Hi, I’m Justine Ralph Barbosa!
I’m a 2nd-year college student at University of Avra currently exploring my academic interests. Outside of class, I’m a big mobile gamer and a motorcycle enthusiast. Gaming has taught me a lot about strategy and teamwork, while riding keeps me energized and adventurous. I’m always looking to connect with people who share a love for gaming or life on two wheels!
